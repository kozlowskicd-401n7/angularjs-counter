##### General Comments
AngularJS is a client side JavaScript MVC framework that is utilized to develop a dynamic web application. Furthermore, AngularJS was originally developed for exclusivity to Google; however, it is now an open source framework. AngularJS is based on HTML and JavaScript which avoids the developer from having to learn a new language or syntax. AngularJS provides the opportunity to switch static HTML to dynamic HTML. Additionally, it provides the developer the ability to create custom attributes using simple JavaScript. 
##### Pros
* DOM manipulation
* Faster application prototyping by writing significantly less code
##### Cons
* Scopes can be complex if it is the first time utilizing Angular
* The browser may take time to render pages of websites and applications using the framwork.
* JavaScript support is manadatory which and users that have their support for JavaScript disabled may not see the website or web apps. 
#### Ratings and Reviews
##### Documentation
Angular provides the opportunity of writing in JavaScript and HTML without having to learn another scripting language. It is supported by Google and is an open source framework with room for improvement. However, it supports the separation of concerns by using MVC design pattern and there are built-in attributes that make HTML dynamic. AngularJS even supports single page application anc is REST friendly.

##### Systems Requirements
AngularJS requires rxjs because many Angular APIs return observables. Additionally, AngularJS relies on zone.js to view change detection when native JavaScript operations events raise. 

##### Ramp-Up Projections
Developers with 15 to 30 years of experience may have a profound understanding of AngularJS in two weeks. However, an experience mid developer may take 3 months to 6 months to have an understanding of AngularJS and 2 to 3 weeks of developing a project depending on the extend of to-do list.

##### Community Support and Adoption levels
Since AngularJS was developed by Google, the company utilizes the software for their internal products such as Gmail and Hangouts (which will discontinue in 2020). Other companies include Lyft, Udemy, Vine, InVision App, and over 2600 other companies. Overall, AngularJS is still popular despite a few drawbacks.
