##### General Comments
GatsbyJS is powered by REACT. Gatsby is built on top of Webpack, additionally it can generate offline-ready Progressive Web App and uses GraphQL for querying data. Gatsby allows you to structure your project to components and use all the existing React components which are specifically developed for Gatsby. Gatsby allows plain old CSS stylesheets; however, Gatsby offers a cornucopia of choices such as SASS, Glamor, Styled Components, Stylus, LESS or Styled JSX. 
##### Pros
* Static site generator that uses React and it also has a rich data plug-in ecosystem to work with things like headless content management system API's databases.
* Myriad of plugins to extend the functionality of a regular static site generator.
* GatsbyJS uses GraphQL to query files from your file system 
##### Cons
* GatsbyJS is not as mature as other competitors so developers do encounter some bugs.
* GatsbyJS has alack of visual themes
#### Ratings and Reviews
##### Documentation
One of the disadvantages of WordPress is that it tightly joins creation and management of content and helping display that content. However, it is far from efficient compared to static sites and this is where Gatsby shines. From the React components and templates, the developer may access data (such as metadata, blog posts, or site title) using GraphQL. Gatsby is not limited to markdown unlike other static site generators. Gatsby supports several sources and can support files to include Markdown, YAML, CSV, and XML. Due to Gatsby's extensibility and plugin system, it is easy to add more sources. 

##### Systems Requirements
Gatsby requires React because it's the framework that Gatsby uses to build pages and structure content. For managing site data Gatsby utilizes GraphQL, a query language that allows the developer to pull data into their website. Gatsby is a JAM stack when developing a Gatsby site some of the web technologies include HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

##### Ramp-Up Projections
A mid developer could build sites 2-3 times faster using Gatsby but the learning curve is GraphQL. A developer may require an understanding of React.js

##### Community Support and Adoption levels
Since Gatsby is relatively new developers are utilizing it to create static sites such as shopflamingo. Developing an e-commerce site could be blazing fast using GatsbyJS. There are close to 399 sites that use GatsbyJS.
